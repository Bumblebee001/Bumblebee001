- 👋 Hi, I’m @Bumblebee001 and my Christian name is Mark. I am from the Island of Malta (right in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea (Europe)).
- 👀 I’m interested in Virtual Pipe Organs and so far I have created sample-sets of 4 local organs. I had a lot of help from many people to whom I am greatly endebted for their work and patience. I had originally started with one particular person whose memory must live on, the late Panos Ghekas from Greece who was taken away from us too early!
- 🌱 I’m a Medical Doctor by profession and an amateur musician. I plan to retire from medicine towards the end of 2022 and I hope I will be able to dedicate more time to recording historic organs in Malta and Gozo and creating virtual replicas to share with the rest of the world. Unlike most, I want to share freely and I have no commercial interest in what I do but donations done freely and willingly are much appreciated. 
- 💞️ My project is: Maltese Historic Pipe Organs. Our organs are by and large Italian/ Sicilian instruments.
- 📫 How to reach me: My website is located at http://mhpo.epizy.com. You will find everything about my project, how to get free sample-sets and links to other websites.
